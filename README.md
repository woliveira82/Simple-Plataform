# Simple-Plataform
This is a 2D plataform game mechanic implamentation in [Godot 3.2](https://godotengine.org/). The project were created following the instructions of Eli Cuaycong on a YouTube video called [Make your first 2D platformer game IN JUST 10 MINUTES (Godot Game Engine)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xFEKIWpd0sU&t=43s&ab_channel=EliCuaycong).

The tiles were created from a free image but the sprites were created by Eli and can be obtained [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xFEKIWpd0sU&t=43s&ab_channel=EliCuaycong).
